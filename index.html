<h1>Welcome to my website </h1>
<p>My name is Thanh Long Nguyen, call me Long for short. I am 18 years old who currently studies at RMIT University as a freshman in Bachelor of Information Technology with an ID is s3699180. You can contact me through the email address thanhlong2000@gmail.com. </p>
<p>A bit about myself, I am Vietnamese who loves to experience and try different foods and cuisines, for example, Italian, Chinese, American and explicitly Korean. Additionally, I also adore animals, my family owns a British Shorthair cat back in Vietnam, and there are no words to describe how wonderful he is. All have been noted, I'm also into badminton lately xD.</p>
