<h1>Welcome to my website </h1>
<p>My name is Thanh Long Nguyen, call me Long for short. I am 18 years old who currently studies at 
  RMIT University as a freshman in Bachelor of Information Technology with an ID is s3699180. You can contact me through the email address thanhlong2000@gmail.com. </p>
<p>A bit about myself, I am Vietnamese who loves to experience and try different foods and cuisines, for example, Italian, Chinese, American and explicitly Korean.
  Additionally, I also adore animals, my family owns a British Shorthair cat back in Vietnam, and there are no words to describe how wonderful he is.

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p>- To be honest, I haven’t found any interest in this field, I remember the first time I had ICT as a subject in my high school 
        (before then I don’t know anything about it). My teacher taught me about HTML code, Microsoft excel and word, it was like a whole new world for me to know about computers and technology at that age. 
        When I was taking the ICT class, I think I have a talent at this field when everyone was failing it due to the heavy assignments and the complexity of the code that they have to deal with. 
        However, I was super surprised by how easy I could comprehend the lessons; as a result, I got all As in my ICT exams. Since then, I start to wonder if I have a talent in this field or not, that's the reason 
        why I chose IT in university so that I can discover more about myself and my future career. In particular, I don't have a typical person to look up to in this IT field yet, all I know is some super celebrities
        that everybody knows like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. With this in mind, I'm still looking for a specialized IT interest, and for now, I'm just focusing on coding JavaScript and Python.</p>
			
		 <p>-	Since I was young, I always want to study overseas and explore different cultures and people. With this intention, 
        I was looking for the best place that I can settle and only concentrate on the discovery of my hidden talent and personalities without any disruptions. 
        Therefore, Melbourne is the best fit for me since it is the top 1 liveable city in the world, where I can enjoy myself and do whatever I want peacefully. 
        Then it comes to choosing the right university; it is pretty narrowed down as RMIT is one of the best universities for Information Technology and developing software. 
        As the result, I chose RMIT because I think RMIT is the right place for me to study IT.</p>
    
     <p>-	For now, I am just a freshman, so I don't really know what to expect much. However, I do want to learn about programming languages,
       and I think during the first few weeks in bachelor, I have a spark in coding and developing applications and software; hence, 
       I'm happily looking forward to this course, to learn more about technologies and the ways people can use this to help others and be a part of the modern world.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

      <img src="job/Picture1.png">
      <p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38568314?searchrequesttoken=1fff9db6-59d2-45f6-99d4-d16f0eb96556&type=promoted</p>
    
			<p>- As I mentioned, I'm still looking for my interest, but currently, I have a spark of developing software 
        and writing codes through many programming languages especially Java.  So that's the reason why I want to become a software developer
        specialized in Java for now. Therefore, the job provided by Tramanda Company would be fitted the most for me as they are offering 
        a developer position which is very appealing to me.</p>
			
			<p>- To be eligible for the position, I must have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or other related fields which means 
        a bachelor's degree in Information Technology would be fine. Since I don't have any intention to quit this IT course, so I hope 
        I will be able to receive a degree within 3 years. Additionally, I am required to have a minimum of 4 years of experience in Java commercial 
        and some extensive knowledge about Java, SQL, Spring, Hibernate, etc.  The company also asks the candidates to have a range of experiences, 
        for example, designing and developing web applications with a strong understanding of web and object-oriented principles and design patterns. 
        Lastly, I am recommended to have strong speaking and writing communication skills.</p>
    
			<p>- The software developer is the job targeted explicitly for the one who graduated the bachelor of IT or Computer Science and 
        has lots of experience in developing and designing software. As a freshman, I legitly haven't met those requirements yet. 
        The only qualifications I have is High school "degree" and an Ielts scored 6.5+. About skills, I do have oral and written communication skills 
        but not as strong as the company required. Additionally, for my experience, I do know how to operate the computer, and how to code primary 
        and simple codes in Java and Python as I still learning it in Introduction of Programming course.</p>
    
      <p>- My main objective right now is to graduate bachelor of IT, so I can obtain a good knowledge of programming and developing software 
        which is the primary requirement for my ideal job. To improve my experience, I would want to get an internship during the break of the first year; 
        therefore, I can work in some companies to gain skills in designing web applications and also to study Spring and other modern Open Source Java frameworks. 
        According to the requirement, it says that travel industry or accounting related software experience is highly desirable, that will be my motivation to get 
        an associate degree in accounting, so I can increase the change to get employed. Besides, during the studies, I will spend some of my free times to go in-depth in JavaScript and SQL.</p>
