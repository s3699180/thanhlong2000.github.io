<h1>Welcome to my website </h1>
<p>My name is Thanh Long Nguyen, call me Long for short. I am 18 years old who currently studies at 
  RMIT University as a freshman in Bachelor of Information Technology with an ID is s3699180. You can contact me through the email address thanhlong2000@gmail.com. </p>
<p>A bit about myself, I am Vietnamese who loves to experience and try different foods and cuisines, for example, Italian, Chinese, American and explicitly Korean.
  Additionally, I also adore animals, my family owns a British Shorthair cat back in Vietnam, and there are no words to describe how wonderful he is. 
  All have been noted, I'm also into badminton lately xD.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p>-- To be honest, I haven’t found any interest in this field, I remember the first time I had ICT as a subject in my high school 
        (before then I don’t know anything about it). My teacher taught me about HTML code, Microsoft excel and word, it was like a whole new world for me to know about computers and technology at that age. 
        When I was taking the ICT class, I think I have a talent at this field when everyone was failing it due to the heavy assignments and the complexity of the code that they have to deal with. 
        However, I was super surprised by how easy I could comprehend the lessons; as a result, I got all As in my ICT exams. Since then, I start to wonder if I have a talent in this field or not, that's the reason 
        why I chose IT in university so that I can discover more about myself and my future career. In particular, I don't have a typical person to look up to in this IT field yet, all I know is some super celebrities that everybody knows like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
        With this in mind, I'm still looking for a specialized IT interest, and for now, I'm just focusing on coding JavaScript and Python.</p>
			<p>So for my short intro.... An IT based educator always looking to learn more.</p>
			<p>What's your profile going to say about you?</p>
